# Air Pollution Prediction using LSTM
This project predicts air pollution levels using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network model.

## Features:

* Uses historical air pollution data and potentially other relevant factors (e.g., weather data) for prediction.
* Implements Min-Max scaling for data normalization.
* Creates sequences from time series data for LSTM input.
* Visualizes model performance using plots.
## Requirements:

* Python 
* TensorFlow 
* Other relevant libraries (e.g., NumPy, Matplotlib) 
## Data Preparation:

* Load air pollution data (replace with your data loading instructions).
* Preprocess data (handling missing values, etc.).
* Apply Min-Max scaling for normalization (code snippet can be provided here).
## Sequence Creation:

* Define a window size (number of past time steps used for prediction).
* Create sequences from the time series data using a sliding window approach (code snippet can be provided here).
## Model Building:

* Define the LSTM model architecture (number of layers, units, etc.).
* Compile the model with an appropriate loss function (e.g., mean squared error) and optimizer (e.g., Adam).
* Train the model on the prepared sequences.
## Evaluation:

* Evaluate the model's performance on a hold-out test set.
* Generate predictions for future time steps.
* Visualize the predictions compared to actual values (e.g., using scatter plots).
## Getting Started:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install required libraries (pip install <library_name>).
3. Replace placeholder data loading and preprocessing steps with your specific data source.
4. Adjust model parameters and evaluation metrics as needed.
5. Run the script (replace with your script name) to train and evaluate the model.
## Further Exploration:

* Experiment with different LSTM model architectures (e.g., number of layers, units).
* Try incorporating additional features (e.g., weather data) for improved prediction.
* Explore advanced evaluation metrics (e.g., R-squared).
